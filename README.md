# IPLocator
IP Locator is a simple tool that allows you to find the geolocation of a device by its domain name or IP address

Before running make sure you execute the requirements.txt file in order to download everything needed. The file can only be run in Debian Linux/GNU and not all distributions. If it does not work for you make sure to download the required files manually.
These are:
  The GeoLite database by MaxMind: http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz
  And Pygeoip (Python library)
  
After finding the location you have the option to store the data in a text file that has the IP as a filename
